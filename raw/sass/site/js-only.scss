// This file contains styles that should only appear for javascript users.
// If a user has javascript disabled they must still be able to see the content (even if it looks a bit crap), so hide it here.
// Examples include:
// - Masonry invisible loading states
// - Throbbers
// - Javascript-triggered transition invisible states
// This file gets dynamically added to the <head> before other css files, do not add it yourself!
